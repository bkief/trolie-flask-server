    Pursuant to FERC Order 881, Transmission Providers are required to support
    Ambient Adjusted Ratings (AARs) for most Transmission Facilities in their
    footprint.  In this context, Transmission Providers refers roughly to the
    FERC definition of Transmission Provider as any public utility that owns,
    operates, or controls facilities used for the transmission of electric
    energy in interstate commerce.  This could be said to apply to any entity
    that operates the transmission grid, including ISOs.

    For the purpose of this API, Transmission Provider may be assumed to be more
    generic- it is really any entity that can receive AARs.  This API
    specification supports the information exchange necessary to coordinate
    forecasted and base facility ratings between a Transmission Provider and
    Ratings Providers.  The Transmission Provider is assumed to be the host of
    this information exchange.

    A Ratings Provider is defined by this specification to be any entity that
    has pre-coordinated with the Transmission Provider hosting this information
    exchange to be the entity responsible for providing AARs on some set of
    Transmission Facilities known to the Transmission Provider. That
    pre-coordination is out-of-scope for this specification.  The language of
    this API makes a strict distinction between the terms rating and limit.

    A limit is a validated value that is actively used to make operational
    decisions on the power grid.  This could be limits used by the EMS or
    real-time market in real-time, or it could be forecast limits used by
    look-ahead processes such as EMS study applications or the day-ahead market.

    A rating, in contrast, is a calculated value from some process that is input
    to TROLIE (and by extension operating power systems at large) and may be
    selected for use as a limit after validation and dependent on operating
    conditions, time frame and the operational decisions being made.  Seasonal
    ratings, forecast rating proposals, and real-time rating proposals are all
    examples of ratings.

- description: "\nA TemporaryAARException is an exception to the AAR process, due\
    \ to some unusual condition on the facility.  This could be caused by a number\
    \ of scenarios:\n* An equipment failure.\n* An unforeseen condition on a related\
    \ part of the power grid.\n* Some ambient condition that is not part of the model\
    \ is heating the\n  line.\n\n* Something in the surrounding environment is effecting\
    \ the amount that a line is allowed to sag.  For example, this may occur for lines\
    \ over rivers when very large ships pass under them. \nThe purpose and behavior\
    \ of a temporary rating is two-fold.\nFirst, according to FERC, all exceptions\
    \ to normal rating must be documented and kept with history.  The actual numbers\
    \ for the forecasted and real-time feeds may still continue through proposals\
    \ submitted to TROLIE. However, the presence of a temporary rating, and the reason\
    \ that it occurred, must be captured in history regardless of the actual numbers.\
    \ The TemporaryAARException may be held simply for that record- keeping purpose.\
    \  For the purpose of record-keeping, it may need to be updated after an incident\
    \ has occurred with actual values.  The reason and the end date of the effective\
    \ window may be updated after the object has been created, up to a configurable\
    \ threshold.\n\nIf the targeted segment is getting AAR data feeds, then it may\
    \ be assumed that those AAR data feeds from the RatingsProvider will simply reflect\
    \ the temporary condition.  However, this doesn't always apply, leading to the\
    \ second usage.  Actual rating values may also be provided for the TemporaryAARException,\
    \ when we cannot expect AAR feeds otherwise.  This occurs in two scenarios:\n\
    1.  It is required when the Transmission Provider is generating forecast rating\
    \ proposals, from lookup tables for example.  There is no external AAR data feed,\
    \ and the Transmission Provider wouldn't otherwise know how to forecast the ratings\
    \ given this temporary condition.  For these scenarios, a complete rating value\
    \ set MUST be provided.\n2.  For facilities where AAR data is provided, it is\
    \ possible that the AAR data feed could be down for some reason.  Therefore, this\
    \ provides a placeholder set of numbers until the AAR data feed is repaired.\n"

      description: |2

        Used to obtain the status of the Ratings Forecast proposal. The response is
        implicitly restricted to the requesting Ratings Provider's obligation.
        Accordingly, the caller can use this endpoint to check the state of their
        proposal submission.

        Note that the same status object is returned for each
        `patchRatingForecastProposal`, so this endpoint may seem redundant. However,
        an anticipated use case for this `GET` endpoint is to support supervisor
        processes that are setup by the client to independently ensure the provider's process for
        rating submission if functioning properly. For example, the Rating Provider
        might have one program responsible for producing and submitting Ratings
        Forecasts via `patchRatingForecastProposal`, while having a separate
        monitoring job that checks this endpoint regularly.

        Clients SHOULD perform Conditional `GET` using the `If-None-Match` header

      summary: Obtain the status of the Ratings Provider's forecast proposal
      tags:

      - Forecasting
      x-openapi-router-controller: openapi_server.controllers.rating_proposals_controller
    patch:
      description: |2

        In every Forecast Window, a new area-wide Forecast Proposal is created on
        the TROLIE server of the Clearinghouse Provider. Each Ratings Provider then
        `PATCH`es the area-wide proposal with the forecasts for their respective
        Ratings Obligations. Any unmet Ratings Obligations will result in the
        Clearinghouse Provider using an appropriate Recourse Rating for those unmet
        obligations.

        For Ratings Providers with a natural split in their Ratings Obligations,
        e.g., geographic or control areas, the `PATCH` semantics afford the ability
        to submit multiple Forecast Proposals containing just proposals for the
        relevant resources, if they choose to do so. This affordance can also be
        leveraged to split a large proposal into one or more parts in cases where
        that is advantageous from a performance or reliable delivery perspective.

      description: |2

        Used to obtain the status of real-time ratings proposals. The response is
        implicitly restricted to the requesting Ratings Provider's obligation.
        Accordingly, the caller can use this endpoint to check the state of their
        proposal submission.

        Note that the same status object is returned for each
        `postRealTimeProposal`, so this endpoint may seem redundant. However,
        an anticipated use case for this `GET` endpoint is to support supervisor
        processes that are setup by the client to independently ensure the provider's process for
        rating submission if functioning properly. For example, the Rating Provider
        might have one program responsible for producing and submitting Ratings
        via `postRealTimeProposal`, while having a separate
        monitoring job that checks this endpoint regularly.

        Clients SHOULD perform Conditional `GET` using the `If-None-Match` header
        and the `ETag` of a previous `GET` response to poll this endpoint. Rate
        limiting is done on a per Ratings Provider basis, so requests from
        independent clients used by the same provider count against the same quota.

        \ use \nthis endpoint to submit ratings within the current hour.  \nThese\
        \ are assumed to be real-time ratings, based on measurements\nof ambient conditions\
        \ as opposed to forecasts.  These ratings will be \nused by Transmission Providers\
        \ in real-time grid operations processes, \nsuch as state estimator and real-time\
        \ markets.  The clearinghouse for real-time ratings\nmay be run more frequently\
        \ than the one for forecast ratings to adapt to real-world \nconditions. \
        \ \n\nThese ratings may be either AARs or DLRs.  \n\nThe API mechanics are\
        \ different than forecasts, as there is no implicitly created\ntime window\
        \ to modify.  Ratings providers simply `POST` new values as they are measured\
        \ and computed.  \n\nRules for usage however are similar to forecasts; real-time\
        \ proposals do not have to contain\nevery resource for which the Ratings Provider\
        \ is responsible.  Data may be broken into batches\nacross the Rating Provider's\
        \ footprint.  \n\nStatus of the real-time proposals also includes an indication\
        \ of incomplete obligations, much\nlike forecast.  However, the meaning of\
        \ this is somewhat different, as it simply indicates \ndata that is either\
        \ completely missing, or is considered stale by the Clearinghouse Provider,\n\
        likely due to simply not receiving a value within a reasonable period, such\
        \ as an hour.  \n"

        RFC 3339 date-time string with *no fractional seconds component* that
        designates a start or end to an operating period (such as an hour) that starts
        at a specified time. This will frequently be at the start of an hour, but may
        be finer-grained, such as every 30 minutes, should the Clearinghouse Provider
        choose.

        If the Transmission Provider is operating in EST, these are valid and
        equivalent values:

        * 2023-01-01T06:00Z
        * 2023-01-01T01:00-5:00

        * 2023-01-01T11:30+5:30

        The server should uniformly represent date-times in the operational time zone
        of the Clearinghouse Provider.

        Provides information about where the associated representation came from. *No
        functional aspects of the exchange are contingent upon this data.* However,
        this information is meant to support debugging and application support use
        cases, so it is required, and implementors are encouraged to provide
        meaningful values.

        * `provider` identifies that entity, e.g., a Ratings Provider or Clearinghouse
          Provider, that created the object. The `provider`'s NERC id is recommended.
        * `last-updated` indicates the wall-clock time at the `provider` when the
          object was last modified. N.b. this is not when the message
          describing the object was sent or received, i.e., implementors should not
          simply insert the current timestamp here when preparing the object serialization.
        * `origin-id` is the identifier used by the `provider` to uniquely nominate
          the object. It is recommended but not required that this be a URI.
      example:
        last-updated: 2000-01-23T04:56:07.000+00:00

    limit:
      description: |2

        Defines the limit. In practice, most exchanges will only support one kind of
        limit for proposals and snapshots. However, the specification supports
        defining limits on a per resource basis as well as limit types that are not
        anticipated to be used to implement Order 881. TROLIE server implementations
        must support at least one of these limit types and should return a well known
        `application/problem+json` response if they receive a proposal in an
        unsupported but valid limit type as defined here.

            RFC 3339 date-time string with *no fractional seconds component* that
            designates a start or end to an operating period (such as an hour) that starts
            at a specified time. This will frequently be at the start of an hour, but may
            be finer-grained, such as every 30 minutes, should the Clearinghouse Provider
            choose.

            If the Transmission Provider is operating in EST, these are valid and
            equivalent values:

            * 2023-01-01T06:00Z
            * 2023-01-01T01:00-5:00
            * 2023-01-01T00:00-6:00
            * 2023-01-01T11:30+5:30

            The server should uniformly represent date-times in the operational time zone
            of the Clearinghouse Provider.
